#### Objectives: 

* To produce an inferential statistical model of factors that may be associated with the probability of COVID-19 outbreaks in different LTC homes in Ontario.

* To produce an inferential statistical model of the proximity and health factors that may be  associated with COVID-19 disease activity at the level of the PHU regions in Ontario.

* To produce an interactive web page using QGIS and D3 to visualize the results from both PHU region analysis and LTC homes analyses.

* To leverage open data sources in meaningful, exploratory analyses.
