I can attribute a lot of my worldly outlook to my recent 5-month-long travels through Asia that have given me experience in love, pursuit, curiousity, struggle, patience and perseverance. This journey has also fueled my curiousity for understanding our world and all it's diversity as well as recalibrated my global perspective.

I try to balance my left and right brains by studying statistics and programming and expressing my creative side through writing and movement. As I continue a life long journey of learning, I've also begun to share what I've learned through teaching dance and yoga.
