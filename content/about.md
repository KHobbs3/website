##### Perspectives

My recent five months of travel through Asia moulded much of my current outlook; particularly, my ineffable journey to Everest Base Camp and exposure to vedic knowledge in my yoga training. My experiences involved pursuit, curiousity, exhaustion, love, patience and perseverance, to list a few. Coming out of it, my global perspective felt recalibrated and my curiousity for understanding our world and all it's diversity resurged.


##### Personal life

Throughout my life, I have sought out balancing myself mentally and physically. I love exercising my left-brain by studying statistics and programming while expressing my creative side through writing, contemporary dance, and yoga statisfy my right-brain. 


##### In the work place

I am a project person. I enjoy the dedication, challenges, and storyline involved with medium-length projects as well as the process of uncovering what was once unknown. My biggest weakness is getting swallowed by "mental wormholes"; a term I use to describe getting lost in chains of thought (or research) that take me towards a realm unrelated to my original investigation. I find my focus in all aspects of my life improves with regular meditation.
