##### In the work place

I enjoy the dedication, challenges, and storyline involved with medium-length projects as well as being involved in problem solving. My biggest weakness is getting swallowed by "mental wormholes"; a term I use to describe getting lost in chains of thought (or research) that take me towards a realm unrelated to my original investigation. I find my focus generally improves with regular meditation.


##### Personal life

Throughout my life, I have sought out balancing myself mentally and physically. I love exercising my left-brain by studying science, statistics and programming while expressing my creative side through writing, contemporary dance, and yoga statisfies my right-brain. 


##### Perspectives

My recent five months of travel through Asia moulded much of my current outlook; particularly, my journey to Everest Base Camp and exposure to vedic knowledge through yoga training. In brief, these experiences involved pursuit, curiousity, patience and perseverance. Upon returning home to Canada, I felt as though I had a stronger sense of global connectivity, which recalibrated my global perspective and resurged my curiousity for understanding our world and all it's diversity.
