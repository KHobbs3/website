#### In the work place

The determination, problem solving, and storytelling involved with project-oriented work appeals to me. My biggest weakness is getting lost in trains of thought (or research) that deviate from my original investigation; however, sometimes this tendency brings me to new resources that offer a more holistic scope of inquiry.

#### Personal life

I have always sought balance in life; I love to exercise my left-brain by studying science, statistics and programming while satisfying my right-brain through writing, contemporary dance, and yoga. 

My recent five months of travel through Asia and Europe moulded much of my current outlook. In brief, the experiences I had abroad involved pursuit, curiousity, patience and perseverance. Upon returning home to Canada, I felt as though I had a stronger sense of global connectivity, which recalibrated my perspective and perpetuated an itch to better understand our world and it's diversity. This is something I aim to keep in sight through any career endeavours.
