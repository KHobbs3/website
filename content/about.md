#### In the work place

I enjoy the dedication, challenges, problem solving, and storyline involved with medium-length projects. My biggest weakness is getting swallowed by "mental wormholes"; a term I use to describe getting lost in chains of thought (or research) that take me towards a realm unrelated to my original investigation. I find my focus generally improves with regular meditation.


#### Personal life

I have always sought out balance in life. I love to exercise my left-brain by studying science, statistics and programming while expressing my creative side through writing, contemporary dance, and yoga statisfies my right-brain. 


#### Perspectives

My recent five months of travel through Asia moulded much of my current outlook; particularly, trekking to Everest Base Camp and becoming exposed to vedic knowledge through yoga training were very character developing. In brief, the experiences I had abroad involved pursuit, curiousity, patience and perseverance. Upon returning home to Canada, I felt as though I had a stronger sense of global connectivity, which recalibrated my global perspective and resurged my curiousity for understanding our world and all it's diversity. This is something I aim to keep in sight through any career endeavours.
